	Abstract = {Principles of lean management encourage managers to exert tight control over office space and the people within it. Alternative, design-led approaches promote the value of offices that are enriched, particularly by plants and art. On the basis of a social identity perspective, we argue that both of these approaches may compromise organizational outcomes by disempowering workers and failing to give them input into the design of their office space. This hypothesis is tested in two experiments (ns = 112, 47). The first was conducted in an interior office in a psychology department, the second in a commercial city office. In 4 independent conditions we examine the impact of space management strategies in which the office is either (a) lean, (b) decorated by the experimenter (with plants and art), (c) self-decorated, or (d) self-decorated and then redecorated by the experimenter. We examine the impact of these conditions on organizational identification, well-being, and various forms of pr},

	Abstract = {Ostracism, being excluded and ignored, is a socially painful experience that can lead to distressing consequences, including thwarted basic needs satisfaction and worsened mood (Williams & Nida, 2011). Ostracism researchers have relied heavily on a single paradigm: Cyberball (Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000), and although Cyberball has been conducted successfully with over 5,000 participants, there are few alternative paradigms to replicate ostracism’s effects. Specifically, no alternative paradigms utilize a group-based interaction in which players continuously interact to achieve a goal. Additionally, researchers have not incorporated a key characteristic of the group that influences satisfaction: the efficacy of a group to accomplish a task (i.e., burdensomeness). To address these issues, we designed Atimia, a group-based game in which players take turns completing word-association items. We manipulated computer-controlled agents to either ostracize or include participants and to be},

	Abstract = {Research on group behavior has identified social loafing, i.e., the tendency of members to do less than their potential, as a particularly serious problem plaguing groups. Social Impact Theory (SIT) helps explain social loafing in terms of two theoretical dimensions--the dilution effect (where an individual feels submerged in the group) and the immediacy gap (where an individual feels isolated from the group). In this study, which employed a controlled experiment, we investigated these dimensions of social loafing in the context of group decision making, using collocated and distributed teams of varying sizes. Our results--in line with SIT--indicate that small groups, signifying a small dilution effect, had increased individual contributions and better group outcomes compared to their larger counterparts. However, support for SIT's arguments about the immediacy gap was mixed: Members contributed visibly more when they were collocated, but no significant differences in group outcomes w},
